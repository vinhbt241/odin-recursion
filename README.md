# Ruby Recursion
This is part of The Odin Project, Ruby recursion section. The first warmup is the fibonacci array using iterator and recursion. The main part is to recreate the merge sort using ruby.  
  
## Fibonacci Array  
This is a warmup practice for using recursion. The first fibs(n) is a function returning a fibonacci array using iterator. The second function fibs_rec(n) does the same thing like the fibs(n) but using recursion.    
  
## Merge Sort  
Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:  
1. If array's length is smaller than 2, return array.  
2. Sort the left half of array.  
3. Sort the right half of array.  
4. Merge the left half and right half together to create new sorted array.
